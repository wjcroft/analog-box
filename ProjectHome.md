<b>Analog Box</b> is an open-source, circuit based, modular software synthesizer. You put sound objects on the screen, connect them together, listen and adjust. When you find something you like, you can record it to a wav file, or just save the circuit and play it again later.<br>

Analog Box is somewhat like the vintage synth's of the '70's in that there are separate modules with lots of patch cords, knobs, buttons and displays. But you also get the computational ability offered by modern CPU's. Features like FFTs, Differentials and Digital Control open up realms of sound design never dreamt of before. With the advanced capabilities offered by VSTi, USB/HID, MIDI and Directshow you could conceivably play your favorite video soundtrack through a plugin adjusted by a glove controller.<br>
<br>
With Analog Box, editing virtual circuitry has never been easier. Get objects from the palette, put them where you want, connect them however you like. Adjust parameters using one click popup panels then move on. No questions asked. Make a mistake? Hit Undo, all fixed. Like that section of circuitry? Clone it, now you have another one. Really like that section of circuitry? Group it together, create a new object. Now you can paste it anywhere.<br>

Interested? Visit the Google Sites download page (link at left), then try the software. The <b>examples</b> gallery has several dozen circuits, both by Andy and by others. After downloading the examples you can radically adjust them, hours of fun. Or peruse the <b><a href='http://lightfield.com/abox2help'>help</a></b> section, it will tell you just about everything ABox has to offer. There is a series of <b>tutorials</b> that explain various concepts. The <b>library</b> provides various modules to suit your sound design and sequencing needs.<br>
